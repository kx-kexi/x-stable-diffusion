Welcome to `x-stable-diffusion` by Stochastic!

This project is a compilation of acceleration techniques for the Stable Diffusion model to help you generate images faster and more efficiently, saving you both time and money.

With example images and a comprehensive benchmark, you can easily choose the best technique for your needs. When you're ready to deploy, our CLI called `stochasticx` makes it easy to get started on your local machine. Try `x-stable-diffusion` and see the difference it can make for your image generation performance and cost savings.

## 🚀 Installation

### Quickstart

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your system

1. Install the latest version of `stochasticx` library.
```
pip install stochasticx
```

2. Deploy the Stable Diffusion model
```
stochasticx stable-diffusion deploy --type aitemplate
```

If you don't have a Stochastic account, then the CLI will prompt you to quickly create one. It is free and just takes 1 minute [Sign up →](https://app.stochastic.ai/signup)

> Alternatively, you can deploy stable diffusion without our CLI by checking the steps [here](#manual-deployment).


3. To perform inference with this deployed model:
```
stochasticx stable-diffusion inference --prompt "Riding a horse"
```
 Check all the options of the `inference` command:
```
stochasticx stable-diffusion inference --help
```


4. You can get the logs of the deployment executing the following command:
```
stochasticx stable-diffusion logs
```

5. Stop and remove the deployment with this command:
```
stochasticx stable-diffusion stop
```

### How to get less than 1s latency?

Change the `num_inference_steps` to `30`. With this, you can get an image generated in 0.88 seconds. 

```javascript
{
  'max_seq_length': 64,
  'num_inference_steps': 30, 
  'image_size': (512, 512) 
}
```

You can also experiment with reducing the `image_size`.

## How to run on Google Colab?

- [Try PyTorch - FP16 in Colab ->](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m3n2n5bfNpRgWJ8K-xwTvhzrTQETWduq?usp=sharing)
- [Try TensorRT in Colab ->](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WQ98YBHTG355vL5wKbmNj9xeBmHRZGJb?usp=sharing)

In each folder, we will provide a Google Colab notebook with which you can test the full flow and inference on a T4 GPU

## Benchmarks

### Setup

For hardware, we used 1x40GB A100 GPU with CUDA 11.6 and the results are reported by averaging 50 runs.

The following arguments were used for image generation for all the benchmarks:

```javascript
{
  'max_seq_length': 64,
  'num_inference_steps': 50, 
  'image_size': (512, 512) 
}
```

### Online results

> Note: TensorRT fails to convert UNet model from ONNX to TensorRT due to memory issues.

<!-- ## ✅ Stochastic

Stochastic was founded with a vision to make deep learning optimization and deployment effortless. With our cloud platform, you can easily optimize and deploy your deep learning models with confidence, knowing that you are getting the best performance possible. Our platform automatically optimizes your models, benchmarking them on various evaluation metrics to ensure they are running at their peak.

And when it comes time to deploy, Stochastic has you covered with auto-scaling accelerated inference for models like BLOOM 176B, Stable Diffusion, and GPT-J. Plus, our platform is cloud agnostic, supporting AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes clusters
